# USB-HID
Application for Teensy USB-HID Device running on Linux, schematic and firmware also included

Purpose: Create a basic USB-HID prototype and give it some simple functionality

What could be changed: Firmware could have been written in C instead of using Arduinos sketches but performance was never an issue
Functionality: 
                * Press momentary switch to mute, 
                * Rotate potentiometer to change system volume
                * Flip switch to force sleep on all system displays
